# React server components + MDX

Hi! üëã
This is a demo of [React server components][sc] with MDX to show that they can
work together.
The source code is [on GitHub][gh].

What you‚Äôre reading right now is <code>\<[Content][] \/\></code>, an MDX file as
a component!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs going to take like at least a year for the stuff discussed and shown
> here to become stable.\
> This demo is showing cool stuff coming in the future, don‚Äôt depend on this!

## What?

Server components can be boiled down to doing the work on a server and
being very smart about which components and data are sent to the client.
It‚Äôs a rather seamless authoring experience.
This demo is compiled ahead of time so ‚Äúserver‚Äù can also be a build step.
MDX is a mix between markdown and JSX.
It‚Äôs a great way for combining content with components.

For an example, what you‚Äôre reading here is MDX as a server component (so it‚Äôs
compiled on the server), but it includes dynamic client components.
Try it out:

<Counter />.

The above <code>\<[Counter][] \/\></code> is a client component: it‚Äôs sent to
the client.
As this whole MDX document is a server component, it can include more server
components.
Here is an example of a [phyllotaxis][phyllotaxis-wiki] as a server component,
<code>\<[Phyllotaxis][] \/\></code>, which is static:

<Phyllotaxis size={352} length={256} step={10} radius={3} />

Whether an `.mdx` (or `.js`) file is a *server* or *client* component is
defined by their extension (respectively, `xxx.server.{js,mdx}` or
`xxx.client.{js,mdx}`).
You can open your dev tools to see that only the `<Counter />` and the embedded
`<Confetti />` are sent to clients (in `0.index.js`).
The rest is compiled away.

## Why?

React server components run on the server and have zero impact on bundle size.
They seamlessly integrate with client components.
The hot sauce‚Ñ¢ (as in, tooling) that combines them results in a perfect hybrid
blend.
MDX is nice on top for more content heavy things, because it‚Äôs so much nicer to
write `*emphasis*` than `<em>emphasis</em>` for pages such as this one.

## How?

First, `react-server-dom-webpack` needs to be [patched][] to treat MDX files the
way it treats JS files.
Hopefully the React team will allow `.mdx` or make extensions configurable.

The second step makes sure you can require/import `.mdx` files in Node and
depends on whether you‚Äôre using CJS or ESM.
In CJS (which has `require` calls, *discouraged*), add a
<code>require('[xdm/register.cjs][register]')</code> call somewhere in your
server next to
where you‚Äôre doing `require('react-server-dom-webpack/node-register')`.
In ESM (*recommended*), import [`xdm/esm-loader.js`][loader],
`@node-loader/babel`, and `react-server-dom-webpack/node-loader`, then combine
them in a `node-loader.config.js` [like so][node-loader], and finally run your
server with `--experimental-loader @node-loader/core`.

Lastly, make sure webpack can bundle `.mdx` files.
Add something along the lines of <code>\{test: /\\.mdx$/, use:
'[xdm/webpack.cjs][webpack]'}</code> to `module.rules` in the webpack config.

## A few more things!

This demo show RSC + MDX but there‚Äôs more too it.

[React notes][scd] requires a whole server, whereas this demo is generated
in a build step, so that it can be deployed on GitHub pages, Netlify, or other
places.

The client in React notes figures out what components and data it needs and
then requests them from the server.
This demo instead embeds the needed data *into* the HTML to save a roundtrip
(it‚Äôs embedded as a compressed, lazily loaded and decoded, PNG ü§Ø which would
typically be hidden but it‚Äôs shown for fun at the bottom)!

React notes sends an empty HTML shell to the client, this demo instead renders
the app and sends a full HTML page, which is then hydrated with that compressed
app-as-a-PNG, so that users (even those without JavaScript on) can immediately
start reading. üïö ‚¨ÖÔ∏è üöô üí®

Finally, React notes is CJS whereas this is ESM.

## When?

Server components are very much in the **danger zone**.
They are not ready for adoption.
You shouldn‚Äôt use this!
Again: it‚Äôs going to take at least another year for things to become stable in
this space.
As for [`xdm`][xdm], that‚Äôs stable!
